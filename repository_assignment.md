# Activity 3 - Finding Active Repositories

1) The project I am using is the Microsoft for beginners project.

2) In the active project there is 5 pull requests in the there and it shows that its active as some people have put comments in from an hour ago and some have commented 9 hours ago.

The data insights shows how there has been 55 active pull requests and having 202 files being changed on there.

this project shows there has been lots of commits made from other people in the group and on certain days there would be 7 commits made and the next day would be 33 commits and some other days there is 4 commits.

it shows how four people are contributing more than anyone else in the group as there are few people have done little work on the project in September and some have not even done some work from months back.  

The number of stars in this project is 1.4k stars which is a lot and the fork in the project is 158 people joined this project.

3) The many different folder and the way they give information to help you know what information is inside this would help me with when I am creating more files and lay them out clearly so I'm not just mixing all my projects up
